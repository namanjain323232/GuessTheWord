# Word Garden

* 2 teams of 5 players
* Each team's garden starts out with 15 vegetables
* A series of blanks are presented on the main screen
  * Each blank represents a letter in a word that must be guessed
* Teams take turns guessing letters
  * A wrong guess - a new vegetable gets planted in your garden
  * A correct guess - the blank is filled in with the given letter, a vegetable is plucked from your garden
* Game is over when:
  - the first team has plucked all of their vegetables (winning team)
  - timer has run out, team with most points wins
* After a word is fully guessed, if vegetables are still left in the gardens, a new word is presented

## Scoring
- A correctly guessed letter gets 1 point
- 1 extra point for each letter guessed consecutively

  - what about 2 teams and the carrots have weighted points based on difficulty and the highest score/carrots after x minutes wins?
- Danielle
  - you could get kinda crazy with it: two teams of players, right letter guess plants a seed in their team's garden, wrong guesses removes a seed, first to x number of sprouts wins?
  - or wrong guess adds a seed to the opposite team's garden, right removes it? kinda like doctor mario
  - yeah can have a MVP or MVG (Most Valuable Gardener) every finished game
- clientelephone
  - less frequent letters = more points
- SPLART
  - bonus points for guessing X amount of letters in a row?
